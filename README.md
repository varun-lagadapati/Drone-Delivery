This repository contains the files where I worked with my other group member Cyrus Bilpodiwala on the final project. FIRE stands for First-Year Innovation & Research Experience and provides us with an inclusive faculty-mentored research experience that drives accelerated career readiness and opportunities. FIRE covers multiple streams but we chose the Autonomus Unmanned Systems (AUS) stream and we worked on this project with the main goal of simulating a software DJI Tello drone as a delivery drone by accounting for different obstacles in its path through task and path planning.
